# Discord custom webhook poster
https://gingonic-discord.onrender.com/

Small web app that uses the gin-gonic framework to post custom messages to a discord server sending HTTP requests to a discord webhook. To send a successful response you would need to get the webhook URL of the webhook set in your discord server channel.

## Where can I get it?

- On Discord, click on Edit Channel
- Go to Integrations (You will need admin permissions)
- If you don't have one create a new WebHook
- Click on Copy WebHook URL

## How to send a message?

Fill the form with the WebHook URL gotten from the previous steps, add a username, the message content, and the URL of the image you want to set as avatar.

Once you click send you should see your message posted in the Discord channel.
